# libp2p-helper

## Overview 

libp2p-helper is a small set of utilities for libp2p. 

Currently, only floodsub and gossipsub utilities are available to create a stream from a subscribed topic, which derive from from [rust-ipfs](https://github.com/rs-ipfs/rust-ipfs) pubsub (with gossipsub implementation being in a different fork of [rust-ipfs](https://github.com/dariusc93/rust-ipfs/tree/next) ).
